a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <i>thee</i>? or thirsty, and gave <i>thee</i> drink?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i>thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i>thee</i>?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i>it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i>it</i> unto me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">42</span> <span class="versetext">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">43</span> <span class="versetext">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">44</span> <span class="versetext">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">45</span> <span class="versetext">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i>it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i>it</i> not to me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">46</span> <span
