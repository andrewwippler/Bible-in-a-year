and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">Now when they heard <i>this</i>, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men <i>and</i> brethren, what shall we do?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, <i>even</i> as many as the Lord our God shall call.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext">Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added <i>unto them</i> about three thousand souls.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">42</span> <span class="versetext">And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">43</span> <span class="versetext">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">44</span> <span class="versetext">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">45</span> <span class="versetext">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all <i>men</i>, as every man had need.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">46</span> <span class="versetext">And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">47</span> <span class="versetext">Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</span></div></article></main>
