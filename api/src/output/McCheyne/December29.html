And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that <i>lieth</i> in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, <i>even</i> to Beersheba.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah <i>were</i> five hundred thousand men.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.

And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what <i>seemeth</i> good unto him: behold, <i>here be</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and <i>other</i> instruments of the oxen for wood.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">All these <i>things</i> did Araunah, <i>as</i> a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy <i>it</i> of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Galatians 4</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">Now I say, <i>That</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">Brethren, I beseech you, be as I <i>am</i>; for I <i>am</i> as ye <i>are</i>: ye have not injured me at all.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?
