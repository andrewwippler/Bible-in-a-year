And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <i>him</i> whom I name unto thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed <i>is</i> before him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <i>the LORD seeth</i> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <i>thy</i> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <i>was</i> ruddy, <i>and</i> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this <i>is</i> he.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">Let our lord now command thy servants, <i>which are</i> before thee, to seek out a man, <i>who is</i> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <i>him</i> to me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <i>that is</i> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD <i>is</i> with him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <i>is</i> with the sheep.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And Jesse took an ass <i>laden</i> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <i>them</i> by David his son unto Saul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the <i>evil</i> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Romans 14</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, <i>but</i> not to doubtful disputations.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.
