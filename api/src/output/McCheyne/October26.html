Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all <i>they of</i> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three <i>things</i>: choose thee one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh <i>thee</i>; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great <i>are</i> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <i>of Israel, who were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And David said unto God, <i>Is it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <i>as for</i> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And Ornan said unto David, Take <i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do <i>that which is</i> good in his eyes: lo, I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;
