And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this <i>is</i> the woman, and this <i>is</i> her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And when the king asked the woman, she told him.

And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">And Hazael said, But what, <i>is</i> thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou <i>shalt be</i> king over Syria.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me <i>that</i> thou shouldest surely recover.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped <i>it</i> in water, and spread <i>it</i> on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat <i>being</i> then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, <i>and</i> to his children.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
