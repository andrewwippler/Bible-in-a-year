class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, <i>thou</i> whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes <i>that were</i> of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring <i>him</i> into the castle.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto <i>him</i>, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">So he took him, and brought <i>him</i> to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto <i>him</i>, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <i>with him</i> aside privately, and asked <i>him</i>, What is that thou hast to tell me?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">So the chief captain <i>then</i> let the young man depart, and charged <i>him, See thou</i> tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And he called unto <i>him</i> two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cæsarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And provide <i>them</i> beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring <i>him</i> safe unto Felix the governor.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix <i>sendeth</i> greeting.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what <i>they had</i> against him. Farewell.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought <i>him</i> by night to Antipatris.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">Who, when they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">And when the governor had read <i>the letter</i>, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that <i>he was</i> of Cilicia;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 33</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD <i>is</i> his name;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but <i>it is</i> to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say <i>shall be</i> desolate without man and without beast, <i>even</i> in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD <i>is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever: <i>and</i> of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD.
