And they went out both of them into the field.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, <i>or</i> the third <i>day</i>, and, behold, <i>if there be</i> good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father <i>to do</i> thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">But <i>also</i> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">So Jonathan made <i>a covenant</i> with the house of David, <i>saying</i>, Let the LORD even require <i>it</i> at the hand of David's enemies.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow <i>is</i> the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And <i>when</i> thou hast stayed three days, <i>then</i> thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was <i>in hand</i>, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And I will shoot three arrows on the side <i>thereof</i>, as though I shot at a mark.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And, behold, I will send a lad, <i>saying</i>, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows <i>are</i> on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for <i>there is</i> peace to thee, and no hurt; <i>as</i> the LORD liveth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows <i>are</i> beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And <i>as touching</i> the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD <i>be</i> between thee and me for ever.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, <i>even</i> upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he <i>is</i> not clean; surely he <i>is</i> not clean.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, <i>which was</i> the second <i>day</i> of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked <i>leave</i> of me <i>to go</i> to Bethlehem:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me <i>to be there</i>: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious <i>woman</i>, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. <i>And</i> as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, <i>Is</i> not the arrow beyond thee?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry <i>them</i> to the city.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext"><i>And</i> as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of <i>a place</i> toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">42</span> <span class="versetext">And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 2</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And my speech and my preaching <i>was</i> not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, <i>even</i> the hidden <i>wisdom</i>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known <i>it</i>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">But God hath revealed <i>them</i> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <i>them</i>, because they are spiritually discerned.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?
