<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 41</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Peter 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
