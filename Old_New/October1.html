<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>

Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But ye have not so learned Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Neither give place to the devil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
