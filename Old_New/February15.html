<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>

</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>

<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.

<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And sitting down they watched him there; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? </span> that is to say, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
