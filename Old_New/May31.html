Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then said Jesus, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Jesus answered them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</span>
