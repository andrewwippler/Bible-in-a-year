And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.

<span class="versenum">12</span>
And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.

<span class="versenum">19</span>
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
