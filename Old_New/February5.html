<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass. 
</span>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:

<span class="versenum">21</span>
And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.
