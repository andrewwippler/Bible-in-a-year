<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 35</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Colossians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
(Touch not; taste not; handle not; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
