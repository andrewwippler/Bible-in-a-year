<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 13</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 14</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Jesus answered them, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
