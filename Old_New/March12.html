<span class="versenum">1</span>
Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>

The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
</span><span class="versetext">

For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.

<span class="versenum">11</span>
Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
</span><span class="versetext">

Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
</span><span class="versetext">

And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

<span class="versenum">21</span>
And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

<span class="versenum">4</span>
Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jesus answering them began to say, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Take heed lest any man deceive you: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. </span>
