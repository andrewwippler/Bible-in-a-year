<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 31</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
She is like the merchants ' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 11:1-15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
