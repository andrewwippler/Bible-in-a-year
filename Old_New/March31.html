<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jesus answering them said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. </span> And he arose and stood forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Stretch forth thy hand. </span> And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. </span>
