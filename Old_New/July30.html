<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 51</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 52</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 53</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who will render to every man according to his deeds: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For there is no respect of persons with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
