<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>

Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>

<span class="versenum">9</span>

<span class="versenum">14</span>
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

<span class="versenum">16</span>
