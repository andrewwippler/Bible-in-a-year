<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 8:26-40</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
