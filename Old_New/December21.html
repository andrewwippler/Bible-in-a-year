<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.

Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
</span><span class="versetext">

And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 
</span><span class="versetext">

And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

<span class="versenum">8</span>
And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
