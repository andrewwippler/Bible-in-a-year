<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 65</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 66</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Timothy 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
