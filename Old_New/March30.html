<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Judges 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 5:17-39</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What reason ye in your hearts? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, </span> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <span class="WordsOfChrist">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Follow me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he left all, rose up, and followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better. </span>
