<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ruth 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ruth 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ruth 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ruth 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 8:1-25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. </span> And they launched forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Where is your faith? </span> And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
