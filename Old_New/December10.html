<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, </span> saith the Lord, <span class="WordsOfChrist">which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Fear not; I am the first and the last: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. </span>
