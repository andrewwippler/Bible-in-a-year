<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Not of works, lest any man should boast.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
