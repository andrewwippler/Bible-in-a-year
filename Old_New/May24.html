<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 22</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 24</h3>

</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="versenum">18</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>

These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
As he spake these words, many believed on him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye shall be made free? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Jesus answered them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye do the deeds of your father. </span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? </span>

<span class="versenum">47</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
