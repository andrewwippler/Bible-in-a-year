<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, [and] called:

Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort [you] that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 
</span><span class="versetext">

Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">

Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.

These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds [they are] without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

<span class="versenum">13</span>
Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

<span class="versenum">17</span>
But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
