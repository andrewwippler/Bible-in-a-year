<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 20</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Abraham said, I will swear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
