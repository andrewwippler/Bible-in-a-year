<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 51</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>
Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">63</span>
And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 52</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
