<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 27</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But the word of God grew and multiplied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
