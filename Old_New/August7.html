<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 72</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 73</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 9:1-15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
