<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
