<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And answered them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they could not answer him again to these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then said he unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. </span>
