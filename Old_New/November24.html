<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Peter 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
