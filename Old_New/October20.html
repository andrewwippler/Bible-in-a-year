<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 59</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 60</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 61</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Thessalonians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. [The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.]
