<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">James 2</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
