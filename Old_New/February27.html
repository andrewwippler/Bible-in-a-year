<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Numbers 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Mark 6:1-29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
