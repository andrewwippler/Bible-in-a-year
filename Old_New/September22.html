<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Galatians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they glorified God in me.
