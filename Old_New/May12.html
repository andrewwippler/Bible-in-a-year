In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And so it came to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. </span>
