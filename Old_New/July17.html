<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 19</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 20:17-38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
