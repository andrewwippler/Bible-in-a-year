<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 43</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 44</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 45</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 27:27-44</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
