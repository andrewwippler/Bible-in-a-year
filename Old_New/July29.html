<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 49</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Both low and high, rich and poor, together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 50</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
