<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 20:27-47</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Last of all the woman died also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">How say they that Christ is David's son? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation. </span>
