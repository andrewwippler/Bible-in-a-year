</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Open rebuke is better than secret love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. 
</span>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.

He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">

The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>

</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
