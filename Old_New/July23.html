<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 24</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
