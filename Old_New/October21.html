<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 62</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 63</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 64</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Timothy 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
