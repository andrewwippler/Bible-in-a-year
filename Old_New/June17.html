Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">65</span>
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">66</span>
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">67</span>
Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.

<span class="versenum">68</span>

Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">70</span>
And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">71</span>
And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">72</span>
And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">73</span>
So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
