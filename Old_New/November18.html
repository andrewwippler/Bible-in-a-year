<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Let brotherly love continue.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

<span class="versenum">5</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.

By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

<span class="versenum">16</span>
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
