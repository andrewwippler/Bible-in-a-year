<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.
