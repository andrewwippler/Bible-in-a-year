The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>

<span class="versenum">24</span>
And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.

<span class="versenum">4</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>

<span class="versenum">8</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
