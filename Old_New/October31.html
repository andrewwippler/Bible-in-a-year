<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Titus 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
