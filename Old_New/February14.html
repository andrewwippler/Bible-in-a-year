<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 27:1-26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou sayest.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
