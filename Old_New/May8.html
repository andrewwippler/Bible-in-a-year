<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Peace be unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Have ye here any meat? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he took it, and did eat before them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. </span>

<span class="versenum">50</span>
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
