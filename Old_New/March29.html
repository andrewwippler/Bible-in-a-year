<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Judges 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will: be thou clean.</span> And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
