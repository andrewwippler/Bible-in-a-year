<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 9:18-36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whom say the people that I am?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">But whom say ye that I am?</span> Peter answering said, The Christ of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he said to them all, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
