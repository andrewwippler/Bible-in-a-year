<div class="NavBar PassageNavBar">
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
