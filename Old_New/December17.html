<h3 class="PassageTitle">Amos 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Amos 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 8</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
