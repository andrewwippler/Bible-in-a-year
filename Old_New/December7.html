<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 John 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
