<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 50</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Another parable spake he unto them; <span class="WordsOfChrist">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
He answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist"><span class="WordsOfChrist">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? </span> They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Then said he unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
