<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 19</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 4:1-30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he must needs go through Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Give me to drink.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I have no husband: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I that speak unto thee am he.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
