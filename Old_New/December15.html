The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.

<span class="versenum">2</span>

<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:

But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>

<span class="versenum">5</span>
But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>

<span class="versenum">7</span>
That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.

<span class="versenum">15</span>
Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.

And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
