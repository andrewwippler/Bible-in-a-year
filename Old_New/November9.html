<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 46</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 47</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And this will we do, if God permit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
