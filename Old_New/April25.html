<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? </span> And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
