<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. </span>
