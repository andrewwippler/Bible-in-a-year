<span class="versenum">1</span>
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: </span>

And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.

And he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. </span>

Then said he unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">

And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">It is enough. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

<span class="versenum">40</span>
And when he was at the place, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Pray that ye enter not into temptation. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

<span class="versenum">42</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
