<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 143</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 144</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 145</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 14:21-40</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Let all things be done decently and in order.
