<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 31</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Philemon 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. [Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.]
