<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 39</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Peter 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
