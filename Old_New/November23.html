<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
