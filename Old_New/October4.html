<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. [To the Ephesians written from Rome, by Tychicus.]
