</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:

And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">

And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>

<span class="versenum">26</span>
And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward. 
</span><span class="versetext">

This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:

These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">

And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
