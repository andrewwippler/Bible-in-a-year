<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. 
</span>

When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will; be thou clean.</span> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will come and heal him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Jesus said unto the centurion, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. </span> And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.
