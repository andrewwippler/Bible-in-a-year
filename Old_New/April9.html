<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
</span>

After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore said he unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. </span>

And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:</span>

<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</span>
