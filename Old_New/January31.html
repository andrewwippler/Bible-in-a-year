<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span>

<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What wilt thou?</span> She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But Jesus answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> They say unto him, We are able.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. </span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What will ye that I shall do unto you? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
