<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 57</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 58</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 59</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
