And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he erected there an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died ) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;

<span class="versenum">4</span>
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. </span>

<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when ye come into an house, salute it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. </span>
