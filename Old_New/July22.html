<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 31</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 32</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 23:16-35</h3>

<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he wrote a letter after this manner: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
