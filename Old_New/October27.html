<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.

To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

<span class="versenum">17</span>
But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
