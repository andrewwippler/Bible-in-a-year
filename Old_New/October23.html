<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Timothy 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
