<div class="NavBar PassageNavBar">
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 74</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 75</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 76</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 9:16-33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
