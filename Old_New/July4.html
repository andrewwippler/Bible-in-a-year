<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 13:1-25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
