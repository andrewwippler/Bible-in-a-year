<span class="versenum">1</span>
After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
