And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.

It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. 
</span><span class="versetext">

Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.</span> And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">That thou doest, do quickly. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. </span>
