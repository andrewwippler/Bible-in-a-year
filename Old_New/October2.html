<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.

The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 5:1-16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">

Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
