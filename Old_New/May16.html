<span class="versenum">1</span>
In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 25</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Wilt thou be made whole? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But Jesus answered them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. </span>
