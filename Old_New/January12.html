Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
F<span class="WordsOfChrist">or whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, </span> (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) <span class="WordsOfChrist">Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. </span>

<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
