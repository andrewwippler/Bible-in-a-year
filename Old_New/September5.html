<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 146</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 147</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 15:1-28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
