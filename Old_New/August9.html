<h1>August 9</h1><div class="Text" id="PassageContainer">

<div class="NavBar PassageNavBar">
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 77</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 78</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">63</span>
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">65</span>
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">66</span>
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">67</span>
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">68</span>
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">69</span>
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">70</span>
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">71</span>
From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">72</span>
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
