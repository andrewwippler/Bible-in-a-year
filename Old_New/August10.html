<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 79</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 80</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 11:1-18</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
