After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Esther 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Esther 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 5:22-42</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
