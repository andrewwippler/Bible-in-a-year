<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 69</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 8:1-21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
