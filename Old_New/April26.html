<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
</span><span class="versetext">

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He said therefore, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. </span>
