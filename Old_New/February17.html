<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">All hail.</span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
