<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 9:1-23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, </span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
