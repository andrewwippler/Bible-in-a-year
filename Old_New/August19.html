<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 103</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 104</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
