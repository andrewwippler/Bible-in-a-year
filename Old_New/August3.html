<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 63</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 64</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 65</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For he that is dead is freed from sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
