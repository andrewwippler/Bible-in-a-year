<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 19:1-20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And all the men were about twelve. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
