<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.

Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 
</span><span class="versetext">

And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>

Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
