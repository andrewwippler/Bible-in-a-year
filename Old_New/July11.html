<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 17:1-15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
