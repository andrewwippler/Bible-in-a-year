<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 32</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there they preached the gospel.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And there they abode long time with the disciples.
