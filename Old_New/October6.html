<div class="NavBar PassageNavBar">
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 27</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Philippians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
