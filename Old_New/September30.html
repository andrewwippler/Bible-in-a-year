<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
