<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let them be only thine own, and not strangers ' with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
