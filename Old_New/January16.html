<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
At that time Jesus answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. </span>
