<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
