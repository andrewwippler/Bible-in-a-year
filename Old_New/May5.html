<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou sayest it.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
