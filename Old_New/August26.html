LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">90</span>
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">91</span>
They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">92</span>
Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">93</span>
I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">94</span>
I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">95</span>
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">96</span>
I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">97</span>
MEM. O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">98</span>
Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">99</span>
I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">100</span>
I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">101</span>
I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">102</span>
I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">103</span>
How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">104</span>
Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">105</span>
NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">106</span>
I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">107</span>
I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">108</span>
Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">109</span>
My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">110</span>
The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">111</span>
Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">112</span>
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">113</span>
SAMECH. I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">114</span>
Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">115</span>
Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">116</span>
Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">117</span>
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">118</span>
Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">119</span>
Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">120</span>
My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">121</span>
AIN. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">122</span>
Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">123</span>
Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">124</span>
Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">125</span>
I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">126</span>
It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">127</span>
Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">128</span>
Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">129</span>
PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">130</span>
The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">131</span>
I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">132</span>
Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">133</span>
Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">134</span>
Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">135</span>
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">136</span>
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">137</span>
TZADDI. Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">138</span>
Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">139</span>
My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">140</span>
Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">141</span>
I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">142</span>
Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">143</span>
Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">144</span>
The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">145</span>
KOPH. I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">146</span>
I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">147</span>
I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">148</span>
Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">149</span>
Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">150</span>
They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">151</span>
Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">152</span>
Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">153</span>
RESH. Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">154</span>
Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">155</span>
Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">156</span>
Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">157</span>
Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">158</span>
I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">159</span>
Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">160</span>
Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">161</span>
SCHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">162</span>
I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">163</span>
I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">164</span>
Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">165</span>
Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">166</span>
LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">167</span>
My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">168</span>
I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">169</span>
TAU. Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">170</span>
Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">171</span>
My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">172</span>
My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">173</span>
Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">174</span>
I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">175</span>
Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">176</span>
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
