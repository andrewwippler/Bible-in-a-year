<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. </span>
