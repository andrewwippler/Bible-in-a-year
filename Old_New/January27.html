<span class="versenum">1</span>
And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
So the people rested on the seventh day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 18:1-20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. </span>
