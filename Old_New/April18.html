<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. 
</span>

Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.

David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
