<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Where have ye laid him? </span> They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Jesus wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Take ye away the stone. </span> Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Lazarus, come forth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Loose him, and let him go.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
