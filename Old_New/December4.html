<span class="versenum">1</span>
Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 John 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
