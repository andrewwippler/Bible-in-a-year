<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
