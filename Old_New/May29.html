<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When Jesus heard that, he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then after that saith he to his disciples, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Let us go into Judaea again. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Lazarus is dead.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thy brother shall rise again.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Jesus said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
