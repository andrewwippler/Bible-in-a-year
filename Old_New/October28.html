<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 15</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Timothy 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
