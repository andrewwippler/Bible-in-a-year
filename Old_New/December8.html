<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">3 John 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
