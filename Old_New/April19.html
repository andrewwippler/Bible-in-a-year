<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. 
</span>

And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
