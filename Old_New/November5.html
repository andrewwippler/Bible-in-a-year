<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 35</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
