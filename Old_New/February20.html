<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies ' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 27</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD'S. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why reason ye these things in your hearts? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, </span> (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I say unto thee, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Follow me. </span> And he arose and followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. </span>
