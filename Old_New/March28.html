<h3 class="PassageTitle">Judges 4</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. 
</span>

Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>

<span class="versenum">31</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. 
</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Hold thy peace, and come out of him. </span> And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
