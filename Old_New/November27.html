The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Peter 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
