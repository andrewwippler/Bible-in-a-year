<span class="versenum">1</span>
I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>
The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">63</span>
Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">65</span>
Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">66</span>
Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Lamentations 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 10:19-39</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And having an high priest over the house of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
