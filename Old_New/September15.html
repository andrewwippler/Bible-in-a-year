<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
