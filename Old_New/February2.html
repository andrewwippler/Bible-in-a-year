<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

<span class="versenum">15</span>
The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 21:23-46</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? </span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Whether of them twain did the will of his father? </span> They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, <span class="WordsOfChrist">That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
