<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 1:1-20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
