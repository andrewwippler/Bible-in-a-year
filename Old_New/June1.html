And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Father, glorify thy name. </span> Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
