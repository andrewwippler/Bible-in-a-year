<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let all your things be done with charity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. [The first epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timotheus.]
