<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 23:1-15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
