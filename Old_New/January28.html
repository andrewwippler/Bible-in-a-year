<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 19</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And God spake all these words, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt not kill.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt not steal.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. </span>
