<span class="versenum">1</span>
Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
