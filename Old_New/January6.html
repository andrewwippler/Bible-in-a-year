</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. </span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: </span>
