<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Timothy 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But godliness with contentment is great gain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen. [The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, which is the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana.]
