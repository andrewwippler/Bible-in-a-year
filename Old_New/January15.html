Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 37</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
