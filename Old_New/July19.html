<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 21:18-40</h3>

<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
