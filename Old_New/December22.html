<h3 class="PassageTitle">Micah 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Micah 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
