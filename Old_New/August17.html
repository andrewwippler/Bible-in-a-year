</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 98</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 99</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

<span class="versenum">27</span>
To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. [Written to the Romans from Corinthus, and sent by Phebe servant of the church at Cenchrea.]
