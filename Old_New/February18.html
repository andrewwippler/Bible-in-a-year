<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD'S passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Mark 1:1-22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
