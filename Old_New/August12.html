<span class="versenum">1</span>
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 85</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 86</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
