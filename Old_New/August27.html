<div class="NavBar PassageNavBar">
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 120</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 121</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 122</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Have we not power to eat and to drink?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
