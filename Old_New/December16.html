<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Amos 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts. 
</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
