<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
