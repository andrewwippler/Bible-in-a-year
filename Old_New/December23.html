</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>

<span class="versenum">12</span>
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
