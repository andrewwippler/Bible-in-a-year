<span class="versenum">1</span>
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Peter 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
