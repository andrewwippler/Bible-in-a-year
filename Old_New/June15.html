<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
