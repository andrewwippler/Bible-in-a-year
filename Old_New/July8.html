<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Elihu also proceeded, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 37</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 15:22-41</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
