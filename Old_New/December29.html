<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

<div class="clear"></div>

And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>

And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
