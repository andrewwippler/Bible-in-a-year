<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 10:24-48</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
