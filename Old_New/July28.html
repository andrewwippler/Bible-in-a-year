<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 46</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 47</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 48</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 28</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
