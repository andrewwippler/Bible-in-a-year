<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD shewed me four carpenters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
