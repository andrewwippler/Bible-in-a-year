<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But he answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he called the multitude, and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Hear, and understand:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But he answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Are ye also yet without understanding? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. </span>
