<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 50</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 51</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 52</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Thessalonians 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Rejoice evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Pray without ceasing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Quench not the Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Despise not prophesyings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Abstain from all appearance of evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Brethren, pray for us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. [The first epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.]
