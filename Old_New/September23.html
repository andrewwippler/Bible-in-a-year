<h3 class="PassageTitle">Song of Solomon 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The song of songs, which is Solomon's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds ' tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Song of Solomon 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Galatians 2</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
