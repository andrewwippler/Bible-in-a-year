<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The rings, and nose jewels, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground. 
</span>

	
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Galatians 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For every man shall bear his own burden. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. [To the Galatians written from Rome.]
