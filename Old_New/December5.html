<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 John 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
We love him, because he first loved us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
