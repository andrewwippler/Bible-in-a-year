<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
