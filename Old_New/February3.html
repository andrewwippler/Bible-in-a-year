<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 32</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 22:1-22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For many are called, but few are chosen. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Shew me the tribute money. </span> And they brought unto him a penny. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whose is this image and superscription?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
