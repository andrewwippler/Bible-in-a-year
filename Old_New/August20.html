<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 105</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 106</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
