<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 47</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 48</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 49</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Thessalonians 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
