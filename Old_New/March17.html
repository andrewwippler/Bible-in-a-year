<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Mark 15:1-25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou sayest it.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
