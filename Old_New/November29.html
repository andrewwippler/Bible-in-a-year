<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Peter 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
