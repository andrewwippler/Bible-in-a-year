<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What seek ye?</span> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
He saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Come and see.</span> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, </span> which is by interpretation, A stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Follow me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. </span>

<span class="versenum">49</span>
Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
