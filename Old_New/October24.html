<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD'S. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Timothy 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
These things command and teach.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
