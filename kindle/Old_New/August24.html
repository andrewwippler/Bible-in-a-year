<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 116</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 117</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 118</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 7:1-19</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
