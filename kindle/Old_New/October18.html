<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 53</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 54</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 55</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Thessalonians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
