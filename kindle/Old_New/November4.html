<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 32</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
