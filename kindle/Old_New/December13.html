</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.

<span class="versenum">10</span>
I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>

When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.

The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

<span class="versenum">15</span>
Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

<span class="versenum">16</span>
Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.

I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.
</span><span class="versetext">

Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.

Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
