<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But he answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then saith Jesus unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
