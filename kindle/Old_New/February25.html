<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
</span>

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:

But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.

And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="versenum">17</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he asked him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What is thy name? </span> And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
