<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 50</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
