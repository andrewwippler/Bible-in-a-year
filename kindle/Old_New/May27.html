<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.

Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
