<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he said, A certain man had two sons: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. </span>
