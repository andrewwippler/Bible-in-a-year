<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 39</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 40</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 16:1-21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
