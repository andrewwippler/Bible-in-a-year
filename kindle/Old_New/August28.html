<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 123</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 124</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 125</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 10:1-18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
