<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 17</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the LORD said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 13:1-20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Jesus saith to him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Know ye what I have done to you? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. </span>
