<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
These going before tarried for us at Troas. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
