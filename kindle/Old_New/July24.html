<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 35</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.
