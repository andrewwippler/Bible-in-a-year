<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 43</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 44</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
One shall say, I am the LORD'S; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Thessalonians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For ye are our glory and joy.
