<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 46</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 John 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
