<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 140</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 141</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 142</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 14:1-20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
