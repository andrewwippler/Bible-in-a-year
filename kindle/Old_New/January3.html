<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And God spake unto Noah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>

And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

<span class="versenum">8</span>
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
