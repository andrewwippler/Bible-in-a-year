<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
