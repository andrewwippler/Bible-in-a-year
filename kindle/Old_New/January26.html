<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 14</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.
