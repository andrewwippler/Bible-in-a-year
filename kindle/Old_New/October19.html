<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 56</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 57</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 58</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Thessalonians 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
