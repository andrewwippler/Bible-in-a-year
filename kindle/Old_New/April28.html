<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 3</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 
</span><span class="versetext">

For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>

</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 20:1-26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then began he to speak to the people this parable; <span class="WordsOfChrist">A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he beheld them, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why tempt ye me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it?</span> They answered and said, Caesar's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
