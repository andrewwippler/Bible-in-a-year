<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 54</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 55</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 56</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Their feet are swift to shed blood: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Destruction and misery are in their ways: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the way of peace have they not known:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
