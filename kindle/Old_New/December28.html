Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 19</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>

<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
