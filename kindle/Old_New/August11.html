<div class="NavBar PassageNavBar">
<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 81</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 82</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 83</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 11:19-36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
