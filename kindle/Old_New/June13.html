<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezra 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezra 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Children, have ye any meat? </span> They answered him, No. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</span> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Come and dine.</span> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? </span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Feed my lambs. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He saith to him again the second time, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? </span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Feed my sheep. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He saith unto him the third time, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? </span> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Feed my sheep. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Follow me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Jesus saith unto him, I<span class="WordsOfChrist">f I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
