<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 9:1-21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the Lord said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But the Lord said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
