<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 132</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 133</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 134</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 11:17-34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
