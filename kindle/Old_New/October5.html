<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 23</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Philippians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
