<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joel 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joel 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.

<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
