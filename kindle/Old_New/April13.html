<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. 
</span>

In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? </span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:</span>
