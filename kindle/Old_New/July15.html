<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 19:21-41</h3>

After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
