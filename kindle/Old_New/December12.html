<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 9</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hosea 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. </span>
