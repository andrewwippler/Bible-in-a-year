<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 7</h3>

</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when even was come, he went out of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Jesus answering saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Have faith in God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>
