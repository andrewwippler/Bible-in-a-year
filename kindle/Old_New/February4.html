<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 34</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,

And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>

And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 22:23-46</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And last of all the woman died also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">This is the first and great commandment. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
He saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
