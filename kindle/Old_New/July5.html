<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 31</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 13:26-52</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But God raised him from the dead: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
