<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 70</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 71</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 8:22-39</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
