<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 32</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Colossians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
