<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
</span>

</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
