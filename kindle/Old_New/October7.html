<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Philippians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
