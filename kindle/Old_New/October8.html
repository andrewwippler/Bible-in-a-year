<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters ' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 31</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Philippians 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. [To the Philippians written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.]
