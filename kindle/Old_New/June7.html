<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 28</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. </span>

<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. </span>
