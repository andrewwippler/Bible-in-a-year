<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 60</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 61</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 62</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And patience, experience; and experience, hope: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
