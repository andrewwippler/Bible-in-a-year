<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
</span>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 8:1-27</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said Jesus again unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
