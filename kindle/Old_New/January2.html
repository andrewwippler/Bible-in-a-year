<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
