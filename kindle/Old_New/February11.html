<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Every raven after his kind; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 26:1-25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And as they did eat, he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou hast said.</span>
