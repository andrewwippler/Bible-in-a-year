<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
</span>

<span class="versenum">26</span>
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But Jesus turning unto them said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span>

And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then said Jesus, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.

And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

<span class="versenum">37</span>
And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
</span><span class="versetext">

But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: </span> and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

<span class="versenum">47</span>
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
</span><span class="versetext">

And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
