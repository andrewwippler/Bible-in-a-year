<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Timothy 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Honour widows that are widows indeed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For some are already turned aside after Satan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
