<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 32</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 9:18-38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> And the woman was made whole from that hour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.</span> And they laughed him to scorn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Believe ye that I am able to do this? </span> They said unto him, Yea, Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then touched he their eyes, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">According to your faith be it unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">See that no man know it.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Then saith he unto his disciples, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest. </span>
