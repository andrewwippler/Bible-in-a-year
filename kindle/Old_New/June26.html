<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 8:1-25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there was great joy in that city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
