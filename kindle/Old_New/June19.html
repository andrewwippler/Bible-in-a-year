Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in the watches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 4:23-37</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
