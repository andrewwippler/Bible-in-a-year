<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 41</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 42</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So Job died, being old and full of days. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 16:22-40</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
