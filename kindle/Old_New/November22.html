<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
