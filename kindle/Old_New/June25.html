<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Job spake, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 7:44-60</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
But Solomon built him an house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Hath not my hand made all these things? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
