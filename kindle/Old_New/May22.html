<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 7:28-53</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
What manner of saying is this that he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me:</span> and <span class="WordsOfChrist">where I am, thither ye cannot come?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
So there was a division among the people because of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And every man went unto his own house.
