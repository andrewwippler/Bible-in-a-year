Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Weep not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
