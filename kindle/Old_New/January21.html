<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 1</h3>

</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Bring them hither to me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
