<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 45</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 46</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Thessalonians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
