My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>

And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>

<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

<span class="versenum">2</span>
And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Mark 5:21-43</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Who touched my clothes? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Who touched me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Be not afraid, only believe.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And when he was come in, he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Talitha cumi; </span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
