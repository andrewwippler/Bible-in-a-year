<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 17</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 19</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 10:1-23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And there came a voice to him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the voice spake unto him again the second time, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
