<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house. 
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
