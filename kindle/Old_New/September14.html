<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
</span><span class="versetext">

He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">

He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
</span><span class="versetext">

Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. 
</span>

Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
</span><span class="versetext">

The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
</span><span class="versetext">

Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?

Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 
</span><span class="versetext">

The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
</span><span class="versetext">

Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head. 
</span><span class="versetext">

Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.

The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.

</span><span class="versetext">

The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.

It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 
</span><span class="versetext">

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
