<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 9:22-43</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
