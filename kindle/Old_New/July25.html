<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 39</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
