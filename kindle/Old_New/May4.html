<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
But Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And Jesus answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Suffer ye thus far. </span> And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>
And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">63</span>
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">65</span>
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">66</span>
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">67</span>
Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If I tell you, ye will not believe:</span>
