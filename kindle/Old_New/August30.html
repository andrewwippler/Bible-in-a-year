<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 129</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 130</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 131</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 11:1-16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
