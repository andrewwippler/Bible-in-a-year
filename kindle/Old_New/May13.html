<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">John 3:19-36</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For John was not yet cast into prison. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
He must increase, but I must decrease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
