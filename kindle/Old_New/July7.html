<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 35</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Elihu spake moreover, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 15:1-21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
