<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. [It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.]
