The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. 
</span><span class="versetext">

The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.
</span><span class="versetext">

A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame. 
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
