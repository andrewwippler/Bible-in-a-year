<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 42</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he put them all together into ward three days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Matthew 12:1-23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">How <span class="WordsOfChrist">much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. </span> And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And charged them that they should not make him known: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
