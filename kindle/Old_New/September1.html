<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 135</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For the body is not one member, but many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And if they were all one member, where were the body? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But now are they many members, yet but one body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
