<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
</span>
