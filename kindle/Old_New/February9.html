<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Leviticus 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span>
