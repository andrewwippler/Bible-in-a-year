<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.

Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.

And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>

Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ephesians 5:17-33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
