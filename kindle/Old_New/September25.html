<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Song of Solomon 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Song of Solomon 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Galatians 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
