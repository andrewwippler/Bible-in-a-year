</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>

<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. </span>
