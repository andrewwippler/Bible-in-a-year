<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Greet one another with an holy kiss. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
All the saints salute you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen. [The second epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas.]
