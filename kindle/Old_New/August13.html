<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 87</h3>

</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
His foundation is in the holy mountains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 88</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
