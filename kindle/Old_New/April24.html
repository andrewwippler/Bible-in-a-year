<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 19</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 18:1-23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
