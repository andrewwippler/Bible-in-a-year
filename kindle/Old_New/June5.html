<span class="versenum">1</span>
And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
