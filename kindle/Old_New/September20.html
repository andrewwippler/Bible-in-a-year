<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. </span> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
