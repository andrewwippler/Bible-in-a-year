And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

<span class="versenum">51</span>
And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">65</span>
Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">66</span>
So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
