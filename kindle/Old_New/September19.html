<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ecclesiastes 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 11:16-33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool ) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
