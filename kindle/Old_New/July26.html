<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 40</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 41</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 42</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 27:1-26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
