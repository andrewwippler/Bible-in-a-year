<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Genesis 14</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. </span>
