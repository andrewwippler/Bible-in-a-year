<span class="versenum">25</span>
And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
