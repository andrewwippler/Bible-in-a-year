<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 11</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 9:37-62</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Jesus answering said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
And he said unto another, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Follow me. </span> But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. </span>
