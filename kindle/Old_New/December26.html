<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house should be built.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then spake Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
