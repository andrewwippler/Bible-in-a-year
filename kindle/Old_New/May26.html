<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 28</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Chronicles 29</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Dost thou believe on the Son of God? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span>
