<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 23</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Job answered and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 24</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I heard a voice saying unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But the voice answered me again from heaven, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
