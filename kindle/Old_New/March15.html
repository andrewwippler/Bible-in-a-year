<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.
</span><span class="versetext">

And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.
</span><span class="versetext">

When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. </span>
