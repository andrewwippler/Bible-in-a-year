<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 94</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 95</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 96</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 15:14-33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
