<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 42</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 43</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 44</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 John 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
