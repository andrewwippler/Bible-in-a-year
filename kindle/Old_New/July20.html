<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 27</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And saw him saying unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he said unto me, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
