<span class="versenum">1</span>
Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 49</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
