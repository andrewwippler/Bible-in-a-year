<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What is written in the law? how readest thou?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Jesus answering said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go, and do thou likewise. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. </span>
