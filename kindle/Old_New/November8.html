<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 43</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 44</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 45</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
