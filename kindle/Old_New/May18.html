After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Make the men sit down.</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">It is I; be not afraid.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
