<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Job 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 7:22-43</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
