<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 137</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 138</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 139</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
