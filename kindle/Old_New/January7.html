<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

<span class="versenum">6</span>
