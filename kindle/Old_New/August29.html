<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 126</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 127</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 128</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 10:19-33</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
