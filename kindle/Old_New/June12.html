<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezra 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezra 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
</span><span class="versetext">

And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
</span><span class="versetext">

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?</span> She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Mary. </span> She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Jesus saith unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Receive ye the Holy Ghost: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</span>

But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Then saith he to Thomas, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
