<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Jeremiah 19</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Timothy 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
