<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 148</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 149</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 150</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 15:29-58</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
