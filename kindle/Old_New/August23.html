<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 113</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name is to be praised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 114</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 115</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
