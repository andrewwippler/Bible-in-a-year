</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>

<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
