<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Song of Solomon 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Galatians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
