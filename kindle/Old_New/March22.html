<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

<span class="versenum">52</span>
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.

<span class="versenum">53</span>
He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
