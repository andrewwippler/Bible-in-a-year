<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he said also unto his disciples, <span class="WordsOfChrist">There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</span>

<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span>
