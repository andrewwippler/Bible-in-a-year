Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Daniel 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 John 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
