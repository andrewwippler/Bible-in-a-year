<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezra 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>

The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, <span class="WordsOfChrist">ye have heard of me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. </span>

Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.

Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.

Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
