<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 20</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For the kingdom is the LORD'S: and he is the governor among the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 21:1-17</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
