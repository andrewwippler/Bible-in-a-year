<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
To call passengers who go right on their ways: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
