<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Samuel 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. 
</span>

Then said he unto the disciples, <span class="WordsOfChrist">It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. </span>

<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the Lord said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when he saw them, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go shew yourselves unto the priests. </span> And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jesus answering said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. </span>
