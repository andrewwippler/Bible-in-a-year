<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 110</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 111</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 112</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
