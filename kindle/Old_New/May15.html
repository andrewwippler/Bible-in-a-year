<span class="versenum">1</span>
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
</span>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

<span class="versenum">31</span>
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Jesus saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And many more believed because of his own word; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thy son liveth:</span> and himself believed, and his whole house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
