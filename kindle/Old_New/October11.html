<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 37</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 38</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Colossians 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
