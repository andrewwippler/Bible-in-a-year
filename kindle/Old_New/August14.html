<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 89</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 90</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
