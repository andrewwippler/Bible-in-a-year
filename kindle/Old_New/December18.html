<h3 class="PassageTitle">Obadiah 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Revelation 9</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
