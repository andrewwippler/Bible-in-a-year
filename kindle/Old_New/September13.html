<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 16</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
A just weight and balance are the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag are his work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 17</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Proverbs 18</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Corinthians 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
