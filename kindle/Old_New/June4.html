<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 21</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 22</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Jesus saith unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">If ye love me, keep my commandments. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. </span>
