<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 100</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 101</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 102</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
That no flesh should glory in his presence.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
