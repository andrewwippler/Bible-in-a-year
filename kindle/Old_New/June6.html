<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 25</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 26</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Chronicles 27</h3>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

<span class="WordsOfChrist">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Of sin, because they believe not on me; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A little while, and ye shall not see me: </span> and again, <span class="WordsOfChrist">a little while, and ye shall see me: </span> and, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Because I go to the Father? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They said therefore, What is this that he saith, <span class="WordsOfChrist">A little while? </span> we cannot tell what he saith.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. </span>

<span class="versenum">23</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. </span>

His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.

Jesus answered them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Do ye now believe?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. </span>
