<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 107</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 108</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 109</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let his days be few; and let another take his office. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
