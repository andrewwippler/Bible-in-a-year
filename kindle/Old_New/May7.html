<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">2 Kings 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>

And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
</span><span class="versetext">

He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they remembered his words, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What things? </span> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>

</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

<span class="versenum">31</span>
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
