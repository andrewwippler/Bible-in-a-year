<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 17:16-34</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
So Paul departed from among them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
