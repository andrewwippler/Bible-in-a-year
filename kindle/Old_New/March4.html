<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Numbers 30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Numbers 31</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And threescore and one thousand asses, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was threescore and twelve.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute was threescore and one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was thirty and two persons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And thirty and six thousand beeves, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And sixteen thousand persons;)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he answered and told them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
But I say unto you, <span class="WordsOfChrist">That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he asked the scribes, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What question ye with them?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
He answereth him, and saith, <span class="WordsOfChrist">O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he asked his father, <span class="WordsOfChrist">How long is it ago since this came unto him? </span> And he said, Of a child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Jesus said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
</span><span class="versetext">
