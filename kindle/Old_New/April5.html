<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 3</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 8:26-56</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Jesus asked him, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">What is thy name? </span> And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. </span> And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Who touched me? </span> When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Who touched me? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And Jesus said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And he said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Maid, arise.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
