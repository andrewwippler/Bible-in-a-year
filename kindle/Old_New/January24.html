<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 10</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
But he answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But he answered and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</span> And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

<span class="versenum">31</span>
Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. </span>
