<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 14</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And every raven after his kind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But of all clean fowls ye may eat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 15</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And Jesus answered him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. </span> And no man after that durst ask him any question.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, <span class="WordsOfChrist">How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And he said unto them in his doctrine, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. </span>
