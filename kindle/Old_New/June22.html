On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Esther 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Esther 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
