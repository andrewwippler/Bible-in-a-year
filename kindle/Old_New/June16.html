<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 4</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Nehemiah 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 2:22-47</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
