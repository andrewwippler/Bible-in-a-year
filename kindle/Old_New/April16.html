<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 30</h3>

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. </span>

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last. </span>

The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. </span>
