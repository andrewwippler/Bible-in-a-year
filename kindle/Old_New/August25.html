<span class="versenum">1</span>
ALEPH. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
VAU. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
ZAIN. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">54</span>
Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">55</span>
I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">56</span>
This I had, because I kept thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">57</span>
CHETH. Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">58</span>
I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">59</span>
I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">60</span>
I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">61</span>
The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">62</span>
At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">63</span>
I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">64</span>
The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">65</span>
TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">66</span>
Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">67</span>
Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">68</span>
Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">69</span>
The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">70</span>
Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">71</span>
It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">72</span>
The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">73</span>
JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">74</span>
They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">75</span>
I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">76</span>
Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">77</span>
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">78</span>
Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">79</span>
Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">80</span>
Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">81</span>
CAPH. My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">82</span>
Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">83</span>
For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">84</span>
How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">85</span>
The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">86</span>
All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">87</span>
They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">88</span>
Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Corinthians 7:20-40</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
