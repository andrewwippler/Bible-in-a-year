<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">52</span>
And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">53</span>
So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 19:28-48</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
And he answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
Saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
Saying unto them, It is written, <span class="WordsOfChrist">My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
