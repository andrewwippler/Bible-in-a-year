<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 1</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Isaiah 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Galatians 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
I would they were even cut off which trouble you. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
