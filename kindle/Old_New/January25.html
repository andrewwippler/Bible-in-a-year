<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD'S passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">39</span>
And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">40</span>
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">41</span>
And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">42</span>
It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">43</span>
And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">44</span>
But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">45</span>
A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">46</span>
In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">47</span>
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">48</span>
And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">49</span>
One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">50</span>
Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">51</span>
And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Exodus 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
This day came ye out in the month Abib. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD'S. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
He answered and said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. </span> And he left them, and departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">But whom say ye that I am?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But he turned, and said unto Peter, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, <span class="WordsOfChrist">If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. </span>
