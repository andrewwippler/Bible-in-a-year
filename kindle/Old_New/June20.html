<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Esther 2</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Acts 5:1-21</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
