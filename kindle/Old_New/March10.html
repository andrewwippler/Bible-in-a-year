<span class="versenum">1</span>
At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD'S thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 11</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Deuteronomy 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

<span class="versenum">1</span>
And he began to speak unto them by parables. <span class="WordsOfChrist">A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. </span>

<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="WordsOfChrist">And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">

<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? </span>

And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And they brought it. And he saith unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whose is this image and superscription? </span> And they said unto him, Caesar's. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. </span> And they marvelled at him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? </span>
