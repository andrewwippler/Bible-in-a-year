<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 27</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 28</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Samuel 29</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 
</span>

There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The Lord then answered him, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then said he, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And again he said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
