<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 7</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Joshua 8</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">35</span>
And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">36</span>
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">37</span>
For with God nothing shall be impossible.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">38</span>
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
