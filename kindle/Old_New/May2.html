<span class="versenum">1</span>
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">1 Kings 13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother! 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">31</span>
And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">32</span>
For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">33</span>
After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">34</span>
And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Luke 22:1-30</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
And he sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, <span class="WordsOfChrist">Take this, and divide it among yourselves: </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For I say unto you, <span class="WordsOfChrist">I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, <span class="WordsOfChrist">This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
And he said unto them, <span class="WordsOfChrist">The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; </span>
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">30</span>
<span class="WordsOfChrist">That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </span>
