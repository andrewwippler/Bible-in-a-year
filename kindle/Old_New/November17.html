<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 5</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Ezekiel 6</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span>

<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

<h3 class="PassageTitle">Hebrews 12</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">17</span>
For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">18</span>
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">19</span>
And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">20</span>
(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">21</span>
And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">22</span>
But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">23</span>
To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">24</span>
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">25</span>
See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">26</span>
Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">27</span>
And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">28</span>
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">29</span>
For our God is a consuming fire.
