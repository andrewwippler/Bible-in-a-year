<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 91</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">16</span>
With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. 
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 92</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">14</span>
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">15</span>
To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Psalm 93</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
</span>


<h3 class="PassageTitle">Romans 15:1-13</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">1</span>
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">2</span>
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">3</span>
For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">4</span>
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">5</span>
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">6</span>
That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">7</span>
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">8</span>
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">9</span>
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">10</span>
And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">11</span>
And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people. 
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">12</span>
And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
</span><span class="versetext">
<span class="versenum">13</span>
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
