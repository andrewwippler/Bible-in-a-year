shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <i>us</i> with such things as were necessary.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <i>there</i> three days.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">Who, when they had examined me, would have let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause of death in me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">But when the Jews spake against <i>it</i>, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <i>you</i>, and to speak with <i>you</i>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i>his</i> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <i>out of</i> the prophets, from morning till evening.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <i>that</i> they will hear it.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</span></div></article><article><header><h3> </h3></header></article><article><header><h3>
