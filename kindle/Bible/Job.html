out.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as <i>out</i> of a seething pot or caldron.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether <i>millstone</i>.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">He esteemeth iron as straw, <i>and</i> brass as rotten wood.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">Sharp stones <i>are</i> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">He maketh a path to shine after him; <i>one</i> would think the deep <i>to be</i> hoary.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">He beholdeth all high <i>things</i>: he <i>is</i> a king over all the children of pride.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Job 42</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">I know that thou canst do every <i>thing</i>, and <i>that</i> no thought can be withholden from thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Who <i>is</i> he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore I abhor <i>myself</i>, and repent in dust and ashes.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And it was <i>so</i>, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing that is</i> right, as my servant Job <i>hath</i>.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you <i>after your</i> folly, in that ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing which is</i> right, like my servant Job.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And in all the land were no women found <i>so</i> fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, <i>even</i> four generations.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">So Job died, <i>being</i> old and full of days.</span></div></article><article><header><h3> </h3></header></article><article><header><h3> </h3></header></article><article><header><h3>
