And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not grown up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?
