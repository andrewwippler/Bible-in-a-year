separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And charged them that they should not make him known:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Nehemiah 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.</div><br /></article></main>
