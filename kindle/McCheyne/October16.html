And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Thessalonians 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For ye are our glory and joy.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Daniel 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 105</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">O give thanks unto the LORD;
