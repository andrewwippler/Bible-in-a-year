Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <i>him</i>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">We accept <i>it</i> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">For we have found this man <i>a</i> pestilent <i>fellow</i>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</span></div><div class="verse"><span

nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span

from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">Or else let these same <i>here</i> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <i>that</i> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 34</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">The word which came unto Jeremiah from

and thou shalt go to Babylon.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext"><i>But</i> thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers,
