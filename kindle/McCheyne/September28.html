	<article><header><h3>2 Samuel 24</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Galatians 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?
