this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of
