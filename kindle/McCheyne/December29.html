And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.

And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</div><br /></article></main>
