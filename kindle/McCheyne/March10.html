and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And he took it, and did eat before them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And ye are witnesses of these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
