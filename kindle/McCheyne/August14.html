Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 42</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">He made darkness his secret place;
