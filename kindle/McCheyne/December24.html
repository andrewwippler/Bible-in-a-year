What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">Now Barzillai was a very aged man, <i>even</i> fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he <i>was</i> a very great man.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">I <i>am</i> this day fourscore years old: <i>and</i> can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, <i>and be buried</i> by the grave of my father and of my mother.
