	<article><header><h3>1 Samuel 26</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee.
