And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Give us day by day our daily bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not;
