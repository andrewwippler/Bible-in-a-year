And they did chide with him sharply.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 21</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us?
