Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.

Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought.

Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</div><br /></article></main>
