Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 132</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 133</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 134</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Isaiah 65</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou.

Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">And his sisters, are they not all with us?
