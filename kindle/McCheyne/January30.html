Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Esther 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.
