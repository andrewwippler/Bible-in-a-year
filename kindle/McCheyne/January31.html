For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand.

and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Simon he surnamed Peter;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James;

And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the way of peace have they not known:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Where is boasting then?
