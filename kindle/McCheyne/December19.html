	<article><header><h3>2 Chronicles 22</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Chronicles 23</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.

He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</div><br /></article></main>
