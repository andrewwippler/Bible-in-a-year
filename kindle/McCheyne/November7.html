	<article><header><h3>2 Kings 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Hebrews 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Hosea 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities?
