And the king said, What wouldest thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Galatians 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law;
