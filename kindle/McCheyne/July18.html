So Simeon went with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel.
