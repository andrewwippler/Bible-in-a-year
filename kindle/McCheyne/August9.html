Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext"><i>Let</i> thine eyes <i>be</i> on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of <i>that</i> which the young men have drawn.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I <i>am</i> a stranger?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and <i>how</i> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched <i>corn</i>, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And let fall also <i>some</i> of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave <i>them</i>, that she may glean <i>them</i>, and rebuke her not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And she took <i>it</i> up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day <i>is</i> Boaz.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed <i>be</i> he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.

And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave <i>him</i> liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <i>a city</i> of Lycia.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city <i>of</i> Lasea.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished <i>them</i>,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, <i>and there</i> to winter; <i>which is</i> an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained <i>their</i> purpose, loosing <i>thence</i>, they sailed close by Crete.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let <i>her</i> drive.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next <i>day</i> they lightened the ship;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And the third <i>day</i> we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on <i>us</i>, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of <i>any man's</i> life among you, but of the ship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">And sounded, and found <i>it</i> twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found <i>it</i> fifteen fathoms.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought <i>them</i> all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore I pray you to take <i>some</i> meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken <i>it</i>, he began to eat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took <i>some</i> meat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed <i>themselves</i> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">42</span> <span class="versetext">And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">43</span> <span class="versetext">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from <i>their</i> purpose;
