	<article><header><h3>Ruth 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 27</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 37</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</div><br /></article></main>
