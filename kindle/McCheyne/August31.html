	<article><header><h3>1 Samuel 24</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 39</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</div><br /></article></main>
