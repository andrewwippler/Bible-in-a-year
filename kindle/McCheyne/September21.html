For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 24</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city!
