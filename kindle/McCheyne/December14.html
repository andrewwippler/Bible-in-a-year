Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odorous and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Zechariah 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then said I, O my lord, what are these?

And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</div><br /></article></main>
