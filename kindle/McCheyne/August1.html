	<article><header><h3>Judges 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And all the men were about twelve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 28</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 14</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And they all forsook him, and fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">But neither so did their witness agree together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</div><br /><div class="versenum">67</div> <div class="versetext">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">68</div> <div class="versetext">But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">69</div> <div class="versetext">And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">70</div> <div class="versetext">And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</div><br /><div class="versenum">71</div> <div class="versetext">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">72</div> <div class="versetext">And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</div><br /></article></main>
