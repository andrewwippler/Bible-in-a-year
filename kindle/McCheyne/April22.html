Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">But this I say, brethren, the time <i>is</i> short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">And they that use this world, as not abusing <i>it</i>: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please <i>his</i> wife.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">There is difference <i>also</i> between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please <i>her</i> husband.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of <i>her</i> age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">So then he that giveth <i>her</i> in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth <i>her</i> not in marriage doeth better.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</span></div></article>    <div class="enddiv"></div></body>
