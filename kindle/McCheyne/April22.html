even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands;

if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 33</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Sing unto him a new song;

to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Titus 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God;
