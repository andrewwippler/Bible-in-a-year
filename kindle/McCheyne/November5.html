on the wall.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these

hand:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i>an agreement</i> with me by a present, and come out to me, and <i>then</i> eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">Who <i>are</i> they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Philemon 1</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy
