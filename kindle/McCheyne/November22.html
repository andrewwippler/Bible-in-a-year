But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

And he arose and stood forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.

Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</div><br /></article></main>
