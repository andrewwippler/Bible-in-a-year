And they answered, He is witness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 49</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD;
