and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ephesians 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
