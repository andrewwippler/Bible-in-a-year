And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;
