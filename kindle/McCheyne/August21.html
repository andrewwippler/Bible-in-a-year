And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 50</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her;
