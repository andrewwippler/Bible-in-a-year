thy elders, and they will tell thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 119</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">121</div> <div class="versetext">I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</div><br /><div class="versenum">122</div> <div class="versetext">Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">123</div> <div class="versetext">Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">124</div> <div class="versetext">Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">125</div> <div class="versetext">I am thy servant;

neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Ye shall know them by their fruits.
