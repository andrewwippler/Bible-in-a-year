	<article><header><h3>Judges 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And there was great joy in that city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 17</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD?
