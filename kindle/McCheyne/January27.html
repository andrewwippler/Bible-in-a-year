They said, Barabbas.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And sitting down they watched him there;</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Esther 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 27</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</div><br /></article></main>
