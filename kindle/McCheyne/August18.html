Is Saul also among the prophets?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">What shall we then say to these things?
