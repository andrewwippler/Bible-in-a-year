And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 22</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace;
