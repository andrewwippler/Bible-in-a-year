because they have not wholly followed me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you;
