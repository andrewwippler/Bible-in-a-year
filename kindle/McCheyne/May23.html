Remember me, O my God, <i>concerning</i> this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">In those days also saw I Jews <i>that</i> had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, <i>and</i> of Moab:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, <i>saying</i>, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">And <i>one</i> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <i>was</i> son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Acts 23</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, <i>thou</i> whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes <i>that were</i> of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring <i>him</i> into the castle.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto <i>him</i>, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">So he took him, and brought <i>him</i> to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto <i>him</i>, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <i>with him</i> aside privately, and asked <i>him</i>, What is that thou hast to tell me?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">So the chief captain <i>then</i> let the young man depart, and charged <i>him, See thou</i> tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And he called unto <i>him</i> two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cæsarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And provide <i>them</i> beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring <i>him</i> safe unto Felix the governor.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix <i>sendeth</i> greeting.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what <i>they had</i> against him. Farewell.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought <i>him</i> by night to Antipatris.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">Who, when they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">And when the governor had read <i>the letter</i>, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that <i>he was</i> of Cilicia;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</span></div></article>    <div class="enddiv"></div></body>
