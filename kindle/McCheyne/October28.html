Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Timothy 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But godliness with contentment is great gain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.
