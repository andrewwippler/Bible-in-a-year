And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Timothy 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">These things command and teach.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Daniel 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision;

thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease;

yea, also the prince of the covenant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain;
