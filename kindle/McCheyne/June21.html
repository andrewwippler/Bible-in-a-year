him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed

word.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And there was great joy in that city.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">And the angel of

readest?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">And as they went on <i>their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i>here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.
