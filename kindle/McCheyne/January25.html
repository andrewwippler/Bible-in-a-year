And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Esther 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</div><br /></article></main>
