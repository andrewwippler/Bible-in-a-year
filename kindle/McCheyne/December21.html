And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Then Amaziah separated them, <i>to wit</i>, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And <i>other</i> ten thousand <i>left</i> alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up <i>to be</i> his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that <i>the king</i> said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites;

for it <i>came</i> of God, that he might deliver them into the hand <i>of their enemies</i>, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, <i>both</i> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And <i>he took</i> all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem;
