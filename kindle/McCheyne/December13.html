In his days the land was quiet ten years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Chronicles 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Haggai 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>John 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen;

but that the world through him might be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For John was not yet cast into prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">He must increase, but I must decrease.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
