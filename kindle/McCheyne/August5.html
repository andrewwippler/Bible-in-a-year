	<article><header><h3>Judges 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 23</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 33</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD.
