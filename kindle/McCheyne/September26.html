in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Galatians 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 29</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD;

Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation;
