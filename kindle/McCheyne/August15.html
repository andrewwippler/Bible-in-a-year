And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Samuel 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 43</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
