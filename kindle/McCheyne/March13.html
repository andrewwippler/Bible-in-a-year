and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>John 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For John was not yet cast into prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">He must increase, but I must decrease.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 42</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So Job died, being old and full of days.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</div><br /></article></main>
