	<article><header><h3>2 Samuel 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Greet one another with an holy kiss.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">All the saints salute you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 27</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
