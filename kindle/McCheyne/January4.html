And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The people which sat in darkness saw great light;

but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;

the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem.
