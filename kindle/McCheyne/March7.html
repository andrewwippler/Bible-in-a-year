of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 21</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass;

and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">In your patience possess ye your souls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads;
