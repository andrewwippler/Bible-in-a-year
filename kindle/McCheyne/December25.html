But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 16</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Zechariah 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf;
