and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 48</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.

the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</div><br /></article></main>
