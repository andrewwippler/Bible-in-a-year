	<article><header><h3>1 Chronicles 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Chronicles 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Peter 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Whom having not seen, ye love;

which things the angels desire to look into.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Because it is written, Be ye holy;

Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</div><br /></article></main>
