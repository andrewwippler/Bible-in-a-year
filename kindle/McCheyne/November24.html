And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">Then there went <i>certain</i>, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And when David heard <i>of it</i>, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set <i>themselves</i> in array against the children of Ammon.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do <i>that which is</i> good in his sight.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that <i>were</i> beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set <i>the battle</i> in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand <i>men which fought in</i> chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>1 Chronicles 20</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out <i>to battle</i>, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">And he brought out the people that <i>were</i> in it, and cut <i>them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, <i>that was</i> of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff <i>was</i> like a weaver's beam.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of <i>great</i> stature, whose fingers and toes <i>were</i> four and twenty, six <i>on each hand</i>, and six <i>on each foot</i>: and he also was the son of the giant.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>1 Peter 1</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Whom having not seen, ye love;
