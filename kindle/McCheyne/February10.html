And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, <i>were</i> there.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And <i>as</i> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? <i>am</i> not I better to thee than ten sons?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And she <i>was</i> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no rasor come upon his head.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I <i>am</i> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant <i>thee</i> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more <i>sad</i>.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, <i>saying</i>, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <i>I will not go up</i> until the child be weaned, and <i>then</i> I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child <i>was</i> young.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">And she said, Oh my lord, <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.
