	<article><header><h3>1 Samuel 16</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 14</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Lamentations 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 32</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.
