And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>John 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Proverbs 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">She hath killed her beasts;
