And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Nehemiah 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</div><br /></article></main>
