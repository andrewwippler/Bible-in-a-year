	<article><header><h3>1 Chronicles 21</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Peter 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jonah 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</div><br /></article></main>
