And he answered, Go ye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Timothy 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Daniel 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 119</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.</div><br /></article></main>
