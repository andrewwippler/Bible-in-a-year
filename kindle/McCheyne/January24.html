And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 24</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">All these are the beginning of sorrows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I have told you before.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Esther 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 24</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</div><br /></article></main>
