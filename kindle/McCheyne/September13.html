As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha.

Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins;
