And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 46</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back?
