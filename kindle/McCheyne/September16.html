And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And say, What is thy mother?
