So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Philippians 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 40</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed;
