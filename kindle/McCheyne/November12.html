So Judah was carried away out of their land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Hebrews 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Amos 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem;

For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD;
