Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ruth 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 28</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 38</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</div><br /></article></main>
