He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, Where is he?

And they cast him out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see;
