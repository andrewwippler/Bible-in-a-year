And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable?

and not to be set on a candlestick?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship.
