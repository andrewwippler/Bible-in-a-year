And he arose immediately.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</div><br /></article></main>
