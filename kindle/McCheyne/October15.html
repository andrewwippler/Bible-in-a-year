	<article><header><h3>1 Kings 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Thessalonians 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 48</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now these are the names of the tribes.
