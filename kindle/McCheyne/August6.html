	<article><header><h3>Judges 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 24</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 34</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shalt destroy them that speak

in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">O LORD,
