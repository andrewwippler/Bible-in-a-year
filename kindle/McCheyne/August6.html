<i>a</i> pestilent <i>fellow</i>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</span></div><div class="verse"><span

things whereof they now accuse me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span

standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <i>that</i> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span

his arms, and blessed God, and said,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this <i>child</i> is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">And she <i>was</i> a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served <i>God</i> with fastings and prayers night and day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext">Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">42</span> <span class="versetext">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">43</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not <i>of it</i>.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">44</span> <span class="versetext">But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among <i>their</i> kinsfolk and acquaintance.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">45</span> <span class="versetext">And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">46</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">47</span> <span class="versetext">And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">48</span> <span class="versetext">And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">49</span> <span class="versetext">And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">50</span> <span class="versetext">And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">51</span> <span class="versetext">And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">52</span> <span class="versetext">And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</span></div></article><article><header><h3> </h3></header></article><article><header><h3> </h3></header></article><article><header><h3> </h3></header></article>    <div
