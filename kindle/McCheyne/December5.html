and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Chronicles 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 John 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come;
