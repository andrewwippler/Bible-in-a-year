Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 22</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman?

And Paul said, But I was free born.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 32</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But his delight is in the law of the LORD;
