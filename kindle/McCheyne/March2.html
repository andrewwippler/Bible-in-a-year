Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he <i>is</i> the anointed of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on <i>his</i> way.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and <i>some</i> bade <i>me</i> kill thee: but <i>mine eye</i> spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he <i>is</i> the LORD's anointed.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that <i>there is</i> neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, <i>Is</i> this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">And he said to David, Thou <i>art</i> more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 5</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">It is reported commonly <i>that there is</i> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i>concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Your glorying <i>is</i> not good.
