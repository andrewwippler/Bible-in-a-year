Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Give us this day our daily bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezra 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.
