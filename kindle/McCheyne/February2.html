But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</div><br /></article></main>
