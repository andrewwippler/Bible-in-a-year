And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Thessalonians 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Daniel 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</div><br /><div

<div class="versetext">There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 107</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way;
