which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 John 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth;

This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">The children of thy elect sister greet thee.
