and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">18</span> <span class="versetext">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next <i>day</i> they lightened the ship;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And the third <i>day</i> we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on <i>us</i>, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">22</span> <span class="versetext">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of <i>any man's</i> life among you, but of the ship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">23</span> <span class="versetext">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">24</span> <span class="versetext">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">And sounded, and found <i>it</i> twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found <i>it</i> fifteen fathoms.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought <i>them</i> all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">Wherefore I pray you to take <i>some</i> meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken <i>it</i>, he began to eat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took <i>some</i> meat.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed <i>themselves</i> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground;
