as the LORD had said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink;

how readest thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.

rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">They are of those that rebel against the light;

and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</div><br /></article></main>
