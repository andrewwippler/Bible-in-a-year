And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath showed me that he shall surely die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Timothy 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Honour widows that are widows indeed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.
