And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from the LORD God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">If any man have an ear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
