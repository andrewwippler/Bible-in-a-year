and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of God increased;
