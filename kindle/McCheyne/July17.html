and they presented themselves before God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away captive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields.

And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
