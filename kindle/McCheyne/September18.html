So Joab put the words in her mouth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I <i>am</i> indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and <i>there was</i> none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband <i>neither</i> name nor remainder upon the earth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity <i>be</i> on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne <i>be</i> guiltless.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And the king said, Whosoever saith <i>ought</i> unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak <i>one</i> word unto my lord the king.

So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled <i>it</i>: because <i>the hair</i> was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name <i>was</i> Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.
