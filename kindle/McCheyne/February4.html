	<article><header><h3>Genesis 37</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Job spake, and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;

yet trouble came.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</div><br /></article></main>
