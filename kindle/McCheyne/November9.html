And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Hebrews 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Joel 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.
