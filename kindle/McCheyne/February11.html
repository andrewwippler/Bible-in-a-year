Likewise also said they all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And they all forsook him, and fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">But neither so did their witness agree together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</div><br /><div class="versenum">67</div> <div class="versetext">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">68</div> <div class="versetext">But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">69</div> <div class="versetext">And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">70</div> <div class="versetext">And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</div><br /><div class="versenum">71</div> <div class="versetext">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">72</div> <div class="versetext">And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
