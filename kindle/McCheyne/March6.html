And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Last of all the woman died also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 35</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
