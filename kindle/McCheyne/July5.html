	<article><header><h3>Joshua 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 137</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 138</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth.
