He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Samuel 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls!
