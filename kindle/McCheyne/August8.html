	<article><header><h3>Ruth 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 26</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 36</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah;
