And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For in one hour so great riches is come to nought.
