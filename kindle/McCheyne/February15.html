And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath showed me also thy seed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
