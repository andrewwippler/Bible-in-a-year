And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit;
