And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved?
