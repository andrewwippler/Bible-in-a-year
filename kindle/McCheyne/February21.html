So none of the people tasted <i>any</i> food.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And all <i>they of</i> the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that <i>was</i> in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">28</span> <span class="versetext">Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed <i>be</i> the man that eateth <i>any</i> food this day. And the people were faint.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">29</span> <span class="versetext">Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">30</span> <span class="versetext">How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">31</span> <span class="versetext">And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">32</span> <span class="versetext">And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew <i>them</i> on the ground: and the people did eat <i>them</i> with the blood.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">33</span> <span class="versetext">Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">34</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay <i>them</i> here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew <i>them</i> there.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">35</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">36</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">37</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">38</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">39</span> <span class="versetext">For, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But <i>there was</i> not a man among all the people <i>that</i> answered him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">40</span> <span class="versetext">Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">41</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect <i>lot</i>. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">42</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul said, Cast <i>lots</i> between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">43</span> <span class="versetext">Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that <i>was</i> in mine hand, <i>and</i>, lo, I must die.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">44</span> <span class="versetext">And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">45</span> <span class="versetext">And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: <i>as</i> the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">46</span> <span class="versetext">Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">47</span> <span class="versetext">So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed <i>them</i>.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">48</span> <span class="versetext">And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">49</span> <span class="versetext">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters <i>were these</i>; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">50</span> <span class="versetext">And the name of Saul's wife <i>was</i> Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host <i>was</i> Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">51</span> <span class="versetext">And Kish <i>was</i> the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner <i>was</i> the son of Abiel.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">52</span> <span class="versetext">And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Romans 12</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i>is</i> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">So we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> according to the proportion of faith;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">Or ministry, <i>let us wait</i> on <i>our</i> ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <i>let him do it</i> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext"><i>Let</i> love be without dissimulation.
