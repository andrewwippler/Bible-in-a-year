As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Peter 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
