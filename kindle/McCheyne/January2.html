And the fourth river is Euphrates.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezra 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.

class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</div><br /></article></main>
