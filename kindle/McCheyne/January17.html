And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 17</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Nehemiah 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.
