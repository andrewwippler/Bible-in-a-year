Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Proverbs 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;
