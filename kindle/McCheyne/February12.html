And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; <i>there was</i> no open vision.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <i>was</i> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <i>that</i> he could not see;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <i>was</i>, and Samuel was laid down <i>to sleep</i>;</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here <i>am</i> I.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">In that day I will perform against Eli all <i>things</i> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.

And he said, It <i>is</i> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">19</span> <span class="versetext">And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">20</span> <span class="versetext">And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel <i>was</i> established <i>to be</i> a prophet of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">21</span> <span class="versetext">And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</span></div></article><article><header><h3>Romans 3</h3></header><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">1</span> <span class="versetext">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <i>is there</i> of circumcision?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">2</span> <span class="versetext">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">3</span> <span class="versetext">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">4</span> <span class="versetext">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">5</span> <span class="versetext">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <i>Is</i> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?
