Howbeit the Levites hastened <i>it</i> not.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">6</span> <span class="versetext">And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, <i>according to the commandment</i> of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">7</span> <span class="versetext">For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">8</span> <span class="versetext">And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">9</span> <span class="versetext">And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection <i>that</i> Moses the servant of God <i>laid</i> upon Israel in the wilderness.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">10</span> <span class="versetext">And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">11</span> <span class="versetext">Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <i>there was</i> much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">12</span> <span class="versetext">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">13</span> <span class="versetext">So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">14</span> <span class="versetext">And when they had finished <i>it</i>, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, <i>even</i> vessels to minister, and to offer <i>withal</i>, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">15</span> <span class="versetext">But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old <i>was he</i> when he died.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">16</span> <span class="versetext">And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">17</span> <span class="versetext">Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king.

So they executed judgment against Joash.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">25</span> <span class="versetext">And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">26</span> <span class="versetext">And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="versenum">27</span> <span class="versetext">Now <i>concerning</i> his sons, and the greatness of the burdens <i>laid</i> upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the story of the book of the kings.
