Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me;
