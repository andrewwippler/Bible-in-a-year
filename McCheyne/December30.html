And so did they with the oxen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 21</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
