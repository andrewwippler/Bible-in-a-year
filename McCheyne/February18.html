And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down.

And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.
