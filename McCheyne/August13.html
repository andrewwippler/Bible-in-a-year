	<article><header><h3>1 Samuel 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the way of peace have they not known:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 41</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.
