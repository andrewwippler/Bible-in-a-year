A reed shaken with the wind?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
