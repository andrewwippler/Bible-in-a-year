And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?
