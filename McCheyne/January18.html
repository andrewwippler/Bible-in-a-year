	<article><header><h3>Genesis 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Nehemiah 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he drave them from the judgment seat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</div><br /></article></main>
