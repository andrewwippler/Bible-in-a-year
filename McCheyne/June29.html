They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</div><br /></article></main>
