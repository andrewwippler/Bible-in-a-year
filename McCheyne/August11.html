And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Romans 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
