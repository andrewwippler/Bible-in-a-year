	<article><header><h3>1 Chronicles 22</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Peter 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Micah 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</div><br /></article></main>
