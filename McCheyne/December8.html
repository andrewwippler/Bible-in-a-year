And he touched his ear, and healed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">67</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</div><br /><div class="versenum">68</div> <div class="versetext">And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">69</div> <div class="versetext">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">70</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">71</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</div><br /></article></main>
