And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But Job answered and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
