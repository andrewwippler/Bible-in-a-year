And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Zechariah 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, What seest thou?

Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</div><br /></article></main>
