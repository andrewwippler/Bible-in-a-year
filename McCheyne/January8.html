and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And God spake unto Noah, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezra 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Of the sons of Phinehas;

but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And there was great joy in that city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</div><br /></article></main>
