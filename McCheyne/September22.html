	<article><header><h3>2 Samuel 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succor us out of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And ten young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Joab to Cushy, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushy bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushy. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, Cushy came; and Cushy said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto Cushy, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushy answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD;
