And he said, Here am I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The eye also which saw him shall see him no more;

and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</div><br /></article></main>
