And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">But Solomon built him an house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me?
