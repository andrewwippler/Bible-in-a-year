What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Nehemiah 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And all the men were about twelve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</div><br /></article></main>
