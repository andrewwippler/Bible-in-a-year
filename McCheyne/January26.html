Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">67</div> <div class="versetext">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</div><br /><div class="versenum">68</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">69</div> <div class="versetext">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">70</div> <div class="versetext">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">71</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">72</div> <div class="versetext">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">73</div> <div class="versetext">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">74</div> <div class="versetext">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.

For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</div><br /></article></main>
