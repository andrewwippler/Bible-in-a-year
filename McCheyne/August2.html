And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">These going before tarried for us at Troas.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 29</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Build ye houses, and dwell in them;
