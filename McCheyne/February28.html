afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For he hath put all things under his feet.

It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</div><br /></article></main>
