And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So that ye come behind in no gift;

but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">That no flesh should glory in his presence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Lamentations 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Their visage is blacker than a coal;
