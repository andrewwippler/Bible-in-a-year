For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favorable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 35</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words?
