And he said, A rod.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 21</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But Job answered and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them!
