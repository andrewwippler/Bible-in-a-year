and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Peter 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Micah 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand;
