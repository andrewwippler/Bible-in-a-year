	<article><header><h3>Exodus 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 22</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">67</div> <div class="versetext">Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</div><br /><div class="versenum">68</div> <div class="versetext">And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">69</div> <div class="versetext">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">70</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">71</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 37</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Shall it be told him that I speak?
