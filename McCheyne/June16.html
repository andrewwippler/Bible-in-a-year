he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day;
