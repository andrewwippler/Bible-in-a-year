the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee?

Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden;
