And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Job answered and said,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer;
