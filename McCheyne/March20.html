and there he abode.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And many believed on him there.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Proverbs 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Keep my commandments, and live;
