	<article><header><h3>Exodus 14</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 17</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Remember Lot's wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Job 32</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For I know not to give flattering titles;

having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</div><br /></article></main>
