And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Zechariah 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD of hosts;

In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>John 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</div><br /></article></main>
