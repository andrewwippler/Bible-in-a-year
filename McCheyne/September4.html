	<article><header><h3>1 Samuel 28</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Have we not power to eat and to drink?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel;
