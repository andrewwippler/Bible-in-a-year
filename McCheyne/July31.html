And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he drave them from the judgment seat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 27</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD;

serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD;
