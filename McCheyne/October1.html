And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ephesians 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;
