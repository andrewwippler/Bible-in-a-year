	<article><header><h3>2 Chronicles 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Revelation 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand.

Amen.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Zechariah 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.

So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.

Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.
