and they fell upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 144</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth?
