<div class="versetext">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 78</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Isaiah 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">O Lord, thou art my God;

even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He will swallow up death in victory;
