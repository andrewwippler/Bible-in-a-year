And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For the body is not one member, but many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?
