If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Now learn a parable of the fig tree;
