and the living will lay it to his heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this;
