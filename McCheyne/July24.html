	<article><header><h3>Judges 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 20</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 6</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?

And he went round about the villages, teaching.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And they did all eat, and were filled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</div><br /></article></main>
