And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 15</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And to this agree the words of the prophets;
