he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Shew me thy ways, O LORD;

a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">A time to love, and a time to hate;
