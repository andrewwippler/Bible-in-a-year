because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
