	<article><header><h3>1 Samuel 31</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 48</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
