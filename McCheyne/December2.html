for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 John 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Micah 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh;

and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</div><br /></article></main>
