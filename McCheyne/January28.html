And they said, Of Haran are we.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 28</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Esther 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 28</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</div><br /></article></main>
