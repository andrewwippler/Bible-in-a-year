These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief.

and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign;

and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</div><br /></article></main>
