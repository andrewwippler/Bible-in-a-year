If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Proverbs 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Unto you, O men, I call;
