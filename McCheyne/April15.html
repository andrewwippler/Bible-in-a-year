Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Timothy 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">These things command and teach.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</div><br /></article></main>
