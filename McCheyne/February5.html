And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Mark 8</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?
