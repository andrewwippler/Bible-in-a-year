And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Thessalonians 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped;

of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 112</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Praise ye the LORD.
