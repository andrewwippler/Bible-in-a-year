And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Samuel 22</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thine house?</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.

and they turned not when they went.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures;

and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 37</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Trust in the LORD, and do good;
