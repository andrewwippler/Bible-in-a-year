as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>John 19</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Proverbs 16</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">How much better is it to get wisdom than gold!
