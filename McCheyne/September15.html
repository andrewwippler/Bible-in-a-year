But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 18</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 62</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.
