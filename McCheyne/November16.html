for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Luke 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For with God nothing shall be impossible.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</div><br /></article></main>
