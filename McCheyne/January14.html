but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he believed in the LORD;

he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">He said, Bring them hither to me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit;

And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Nehemiah 4</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded.
