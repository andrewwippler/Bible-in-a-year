And Elijah departed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Thessalonians 1</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Daniel 5</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then was Daniel brought in before the king.

and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE;
