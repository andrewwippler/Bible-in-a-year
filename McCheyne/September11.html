So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 16</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Let all your things be done with charity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">The churches of Asia salute you.
