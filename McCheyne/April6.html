and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">His ways are always grievous;
