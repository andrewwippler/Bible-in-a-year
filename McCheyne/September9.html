	<article><header><h3>2 Samuel 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 14</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Let all things be done decently and in order.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight;
