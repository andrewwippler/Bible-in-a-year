And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</div><br /></article></main>
