Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Proverbs 10</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The proverbs of Solomon.
