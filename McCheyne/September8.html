	<article><header><h3>2 Samuel 2</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Corinthians 13</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 11</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
