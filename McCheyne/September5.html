And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>1 Samuel 30</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou?
