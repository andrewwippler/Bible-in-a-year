If he said, Nay;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And Jephthah judged Israel six years.

and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 25</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking;
