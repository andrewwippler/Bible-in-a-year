for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 3</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 12</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Matthew 26</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">50</div> <div class="versetext">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">51</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</div><br /><div class="versenum">52</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</div><br /><div class="versenum">53</div> <div class="versetext">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</div><br /><div class="versenum">54</div> <div class="versetext">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</div><br /><div class="versenum">55</div> <div class="versetext">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">56</div> <div class="versetext">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">57</div> <div class="versetext">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">58</div> <div class="versetext">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</div><br /><div class="versenum">59</div> <div class="versetext">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</div><br /><div class="versenum">60</div> <div class="versetext">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</div><br /><div class="versenum">61</div> <div class="versetext">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</div><br /><div class="versenum">62</div> <div class="versetext">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">63</div> <div class="versetext">But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">64</div> <div class="versetext">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div><br /><div class="versenum">65</div> <div class="versetext">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</div><br /><div class="versenum">66</div> <div class="versetext">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">67</div> <div class="versetext">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</div><br /><div class="versenum">68</div> <div class="versetext">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</div><br /><div class="versenum">69</div> <div class="versetext">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">70</div> <div class="versetext">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">71</div> <div class="versetext">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">72</div> <div class="versetext">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">73</div> <div class="versetext">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">74</div> <div class="versetext">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</div><br /><div class="versenum">75</div> <div class="versetext">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</div><br /></article></main>
