And he said, I am.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honor?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Acts 17</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">So Paul departed from among them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Jeremiah 26</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them?
