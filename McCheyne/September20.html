And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 9</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 23</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</div><br /><div class="versenum">34</div> <div class="versetext">Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</div><br /><div class="versenum">35</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</div><br /><div class="versenum">36</div> <div class="versetext">The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</div><br /><div class="versenum">37</div> <div class="versetext">That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</div><br /><div class="versenum">38</div> <div class="versetext">Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</div><br /><div class="versenum">39</div> <div class="versetext">For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</div><br /><div class="versenum">40</div> <div class="versetext">And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</div><br /><div class="versenum">41</div> <div class="versetext">And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</div><br /><div class="versenum">42</div> <div class="versetext">And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</div><br /><div class="versenum">43</div> <div class="versetext">Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?</div><br /><div class="versenum">44</div> <div class="versetext">Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</div><br /><div class="versenum">45</div> <div class="versetext">And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</div><br /><div class="versenum">46</div> <div class="versetext">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</div><br /><div class="versenum">47</div> <div class="versetext">And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">48</div> <div class="versetext">Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</div><br /><div class="versenum">49</div> <div class="versetext">And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Psalms 70</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME;
