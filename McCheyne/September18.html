	<article><header><h3>2 Samuel 14</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">17</div> <div class="versetext">Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</div><br /><div class="versenum">18</div> <div class="versetext">Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</div><br /><div class="versenum">19</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</div><br /><div class="versenum">20</div> <div class="versetext">To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">21</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</div><br /><div class="versenum">22</div> <div class="versetext">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</div><br /><div class="versenum">23</div> <div class="versetext">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</div><br /><div class="versenum">24</div> <div class="versetext">And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">25</div> <div class="versetext">But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">26</div> <div class="versetext">And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</div><br /><div class="versenum">27</div> <div class="versetext">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</div><br /><div class="versenum">28</div> <div class="versetext">So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</div><br /><div class="versenum">29</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</div><br /><div class="versenum">30</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</div><br /><div class="versenum">31</div> <div class="versetext">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</div><br /><div class="versenum">32</div> <div class="versetext">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</div><br /><div class="versenum">33</div> <div class="versetext">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>2 Corinthians 7</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">8</div> <div class="versetext">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</div><br /><div class="versenum">9</div> <div class="versetext">Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</div><br /><div class="versenum">10</div> <div class="versetext">For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</div><br /><div class="versenum">11</div> <div class="versetext">For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</div><br /><div class="versenum">12</div> <div class="versetext">Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</div><br /><div class="versenum">13</div> <div class="versetext">Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</div><br /><div class="versenum">14</div> <div class="versetext">For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</div><br /><div class="versenum">15</div> <div class="versetext">And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</div><br /><div class="versenum">16</div> <div class="versetext">I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</div><br /></article><article><header><h3>Ezekiel 21</h3></header><div class="clear"></div><div class="versenum">1</div> <div class="versetext">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><br /><div class="versenum">2</div> <div class="versetext">Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,</div><br /><div class="versenum">3</div> <div class="versetext">And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</div><br /><div class="versenum">4</div> <div class="versetext">Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</div><br /><div class="versenum">5</div> <div class="versetext">That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</div><br /><div class="versenum">6</div> <div class="versetext">Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</div><br /><div class="versenum">7</div> <div class="versetext">And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
